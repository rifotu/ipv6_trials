A simple GLIB based program which periodically reads coordinates from gpsd.

The logs directory contains a sample gps log which can be fed to gpsfake:

gpsfake 1334-N-20071129-GTA01-A3.log

Make sure gpsd is not running before attempting to run gpsfake.

The data was taken from a Neo 1973 in central London. It will take a moment
to start showing coordinates.
